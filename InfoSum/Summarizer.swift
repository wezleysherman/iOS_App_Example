// The Summarizer class is built to take in a large body of text and summarize                                //
// down to a given number of sentences.                                                                       //
//                                                                                                            //
// First, the class takes  the body of text and breaks down down to an array of words                         //
// It then counts how many times each word occurs in the text and stores it in a dictionary.                  //
// The class then takes that dictonary and sorts it -- grabbing `totalKeyWords` number of items               //
// from the top.                                                                                              //
//                                                                                                            //
// Finally, the class breaks down the textbody into sentences, finds how many times a keyword appears         //
// in the sentence, and then grabs the most heabily weighted sentences.                                       //
// The class will then assign a new `summary` object with the `link`, `title`, and `summary`.                 //

     *              or if we can fetch a previously summarized article.
     * 2. If we must summarize a new article, we will get the textbody of the webpage.
     * 3. We split the textbody into an array of each word and count their reoccurrences.
     * 4. We then return the highest occurrances of `keyWordCount` number of words.
     * 5. After that, we break down the textbody to an array of sentences.
     * 6. We then look through each sentence and rate it depending on the number of keywords it contains.
     * 7. The highest rated sentences will be processed and turned into a single string.
     * 8. We then set the `newSummary` attributes and store it in `summarys` array
